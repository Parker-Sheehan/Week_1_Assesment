// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design 
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, during which software developers will collect and analys information about the products they plan to create"
const design = "This is the third step, in this step developers will use the information from above to create a plan for how the product will look function and how to acomplish creating it"
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, but also the first one in which code is actually being used. This is where the developers will actualy work on completing the project."
const testingAndIntegration = "During this step developers will go through and test the product look for and fix bugs then launch the product"
const maintain = "This is the final step of the SDLC but it's also unending because this step is all about keeping a project up and running and making little tweaks here and there to fix features/bugs"
